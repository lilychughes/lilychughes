<p>We use a combination of genetics and data from natural history collections to further our understanding of the biodiversity of fishes.</p>

<p>Some of our research interests include:</p>

<p><strong>Phylogenomics</strong> - Using genome-scale datasets to elucidate the evolutionary relationships among fish species and lineages.</p>

<p><strong>Biogeography &amp; Phylogeography</strong> - Understanding the patterns and processes that determine the geographic distributions of species and genetic lineages.</p>

<p><strong>Adaptation Genomics</strong> - Investigating the genetic basis of traits that have been important in fish evolution.</p>
