  description: Lead by PhD Candidate [Chloe M. Nash](https://chloemnash.wordpress.com) at University of Chicago, we investigated the evolutionary history of goatfishes and found that they emerged surprisingly recently! Most goatfish species evolved within the past 5 million years, but have relatively conserved morphology.
