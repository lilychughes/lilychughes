  image: goatfish.png
  description: Lead by PhD Candidate [Chloe M. Nash](https://chloemnash.wordpress.com) at University of Chicago, we investigated the evolutionary history of goatfishes and found that they emerged surprisingly recently! Most goatfish species evolved within the past 5 million years, but have relatively conserved morphology.

  description: Ancient evolutionary radiations with rapid branching at the base of the tree are difficult problems in phylogenetics. We show how different measures of branch support compare in resolving these difficult clades. \* These authors contributed equally to this article.
