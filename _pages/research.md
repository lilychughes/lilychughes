# Research

We use a combination of genetics and data from natural history collections to further our understanding of the biodiversity of fishes. 

Some of our research interests include:

**Phylogenomics** - Using genome-scale datasets to elucidate the evolutionary relationships among fish species and lineages.

**Biogeography & Phylogeography** - Understanding the patterns and processes that determine the geographic distributions of species and genetic lineages.

**Adaptation Genomics** - Investigating the genetic basis of traits that have been important in fish evolution.


### ... and more.
